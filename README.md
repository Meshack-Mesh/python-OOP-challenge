# 🐶 Python OOP Challenge
You’ll create a virtual pet with attributes like hunger, energy, and happiness — and teach it tricks too! 🎉

## 🧠 Project Objective

Create a `Pet` class with the ability to eat, sleep, play, and learn tricks. This challenge helps reinforce key OOP concepts including:

- Classes and Objects
- Attributes and Methods
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Encapsulation
- Basic List Handling

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🐾 Features

### Attributes:
- `name`: Pet’s name
- `hunger`: 0–10 scale (0 = full, 10 = starving)
- `energy`: 0–10 scale (0 = exhausted, 10 = energetic)
- `happiness`: 0–10 scale (0 = sad, 10 = very happy)
- `tricks`: a list to store learned tricks

### Methods:
- `eat()`: Reduces hunger and increases happiness
- `sleep()`: Boosts energy
- `play()`: Decreases energy, increases happiness and hunger
- `train(trick)`: Teaches the pet a new trick
- `show_tricks()`: Displays all learned tricks
- `get_status()`: Shows the current status of the pet
Lola is eating...
Lola is playing...
Lola is sleeping...
Lola's current status:
Hunger: 2
Energy: 8
Happiness: 9
Tricks: ['roll over', 'play dead']
